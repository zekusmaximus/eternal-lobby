1. Project Definition & Core Mechanics
1.1 Goals
1. Capture the Atmosphere of Waiting: The experience should feel empty, static, and tension-filled, with periodic hints of potential change that never quite comes.

2. Encourage Existential Reflection: Players should have space and motivation to converse or ruminate about the act of waiting.

3. Maintain a Minimalistic Aesthetic: Use simple visuals and restrained sound design to highlight the hollowness and emphasize the players’ conversations or internal monologues.

1.2 Core Gameplay Loop
   * Players enter an empty web-based lobby that promises, “Godot (or some other figure) is about to arrive.”

   * Small events or prompts appear intermittently (randomly or on a timer), offering minimal forms of engagement (e.g., examine a flickering light, check the hallway, or interact with an NPC that briefly appears).

   * Nothing truly changes or progresses—players ultimately find themselves back in the same waiting area.

2. Technology & Architecture
2.1 Front End
      * Frameworks/Libraries:

         * Use a lightweight JS framework (e.g., Vue.js, React, or Svelte) for dynamic UI updates.

         * Consider plain HTML/CSS/JS if minimal is easier to maintain and fits the artistic vision.

            * UI Components:

               * A central “lobby” screen.

               * A minimal text/chat area for conversation.

               * Subtle animations or transitions for when events occur or day/night cycles shift.

2.2 Back End
                  * Server Technology:

                     * Could use Node.js with a real-time framework like Socket.IO for multiplayer chat and events.

                     * Alternatively, a lightweight, serverless approach (e.g., Firebase) if you prefer simplicity for storing minimal player data.

                        * Persistent Data Storage:

                           * Store minimal information: user login/IDs, chat logs, and environment state (e.g., current day/night cycle, “flickers” triggered).

                           * If the game includes some daily or cyclical changes, keep a record of environment states or triggers.

2.3 Networking
                              * Real-time or Polling:

                                 * If you want players to see each other in real time, use WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO).

                                 * If asynchronous, a simpler REST approach with set refresh/polling intervals could suffice.

                                    * Scalability & Session Management:

                                       * Handle concurrent user sessions by assigning each connection to the same “lobby” environment or instantiating separate lobbies per group (though that might dilute the feeling of communal waiting).

3. Design & Aesthetics
3.1 Visual Style
                                          * Minimalism:

                                             * A mostly monochrome or grayscale interface with sparse elements (one background, a faint silhouette of a corridor, a single flickering lamp, etc.).

                                                * Subtle Shifts:

                                                   * Gradual changes (dimming lights, shifting background hue) to indicate the slow passage of time.

                                                      * Empty Space Emphasis:

                                                         * Use negative space and minimal UI elements to evoke emptiness and highlight the futility.

3.2 Sound & Music
                                                            * Ambient Loops:

                                                               * Low, looping ambiance (like faint wind or distant dripping water).

                                                               * Occasionally layer subtle, random sounds—footsteps, doors opening in the distance—but never show who made them.

                                                                  * No Traditional Music:

                                                                     * Rely on sparse ambient tones to maintain tension.

4. Game Mechanics in Detail
4.1 Lobby Environment
                                                                        * Default View:

                                                                           * A central screen showing the empty lobby, a chat window, and a minimal set of clickable elements (“Inspect Flickering Light,” “Look Down the Hallway,” etc.).

                                                                              * Shifting Day/Night Cycle:

                                                                                 * Every X minutes, the background color shifts or an on-screen clock edges forward, implying time has passed.

                                                                                 * Exaggerate time-lapse (like a day passing every 10 minutes) to underscore the weariness of repeated cycles.

4.2 Minimal Interactions
                                                                                    * Periodic Prompts:

                                                                                       * Appear randomly (e.g., once every few minutes) with cryptic text (“Did you hear that?”). Clicking might yield a short line or text snippet, then fade.

                                                                                          * NPC Cameos:

                                                                                             * NPCs pop in briefly (e.g., a caretaker who says, “Oh, still here?” then leaves).

                                                                                             * Provide no real progression—just an unsettling sense that something might happen.

4.3 Player Communication
                                                                                                * Chat System:

                                                                                                   * Real-time chat for multiplayer. Allow players to discuss their predicament, share existential woes, or speculate about Godot’s arrival.

                                                                                                   * Possibly incorporate ephemeral chat messages that vanish after a short time, reinforcing the fleeting nature of communication.

                                                                                                      * Emotive Prompts:

                                                                                                         * Give players the option to “express despair,” “pace anxiously,” or “hope out loud,” each playing a small animation or text snippet.

4.4 Progression (or Lack Thereof)
                                                                                                            * Subtle ‘Levels of Despair’ (Optional):

                                                                                                               * Instead of traditional XP, players might accumulate an internal state (e.g., “Resignation,” “Frustration,” “Apathy”), which modifies small text descriptions (like an optional flavor text: “You sink into the bench, now feeling 10% more Resigned.”).

                                                                                                               * These states do not unlock new areas but subtly influence the tone of the environment or the player’s chat color.

                                                                                                                  * Infinite Loop:

                                                                                                                     * No official end screen or sense of finality. If a user logs off, the next time they return, the cycle has advanced, but it’s the same old waiting room.

                                                                                                                        3. Random Prompt System: Script a few random events or prompts to appear at intervals.

Phase 2: Aesthetic & Atmosphere
                                                                                                                           1. UI/UX Refinement: Incorporate the final color palette, fonts, and layout.

                                                                                                                           2. Ambient Sound: Add low-level ambient track(s), random environmental SFX triggers.

                                                                                                                           3. Subtle Visual Effects: Implement day/night changes or minor background shifts.

Phase 3: NPC & Minimal Interaction
                                                                                                                              1. NPC Module: Script cameo appearances with random lines.

                                                                                                                              2. Interactive Elements: Implement clickable prompts that yield cryptic text or minimal feedback.

Phase 4: Extended Features
                                                                                                                                 1. Emotive Actions: Let players express intangible states (“mutter in despair,” etc.).

                                                                                                                                 2. “Despair Points” or Similar: Track intangible progression states (optional).

                                                                                                                                 3. Additional Environmental Variety: Add more random events, illusions, or fleeting phenomena to maintain interest over time.

Phase 5: Refinement & Testing
                                                                                                                                    1. Playtesting: Gather feedback from a small group to ensure the pacing and ambiance achieve the intended mood (enough variety to stay intriguing, but not enough to break the existential stasis).

                                                                                                                                    2. Performance Optimizations: Streamline data handling and ensure chat events don’t overload the server if many players connect.

                                                                                                                                    3. Bug Fixes & Polishing: Iron out any issues with random events triggering improperly, continuity resets, or UI glitches.

Phase 6: Deployment
                                                                                                                                       1. Hosting & Scalability: Launch on a hosting platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or a dedicated server).

                                                                                                                                       2. Monitoring: Track concurrency and usage.

                                                                                                                                       3. Ongoing Content Tweaks: Possibly add new cryptic events over time to keep the “waiting” environment slightly unpredictable.

6. Potential Extra Touches
                                                                                                                                          * Discord Integration (Optional): Link a Discord bot that posts cryptic updates about “Godot’s arrival” to maintain the theme outside the game environment.

                                                                                                                                          * Daily Mystery “Clue”: Each real-world day, an NPC spawns or a new prompt appears, always teasing an imminent arrival but never concluding.

                                                                                                                                          * Branching Hallways That Lead Nowhere: If you let players wander into adjacent “empty rooms,” each is equally void, reinforcing the sense of no real escape.

7. Team & Timeline
                                                                                                                                             * 1–2 Months for Core MVP:

                                                                                                                                                * Week 1: Basic lobby environment, chat functionality, minimal design.

                                                                                                                                                * Week 2–3: Implement random prompts, subtle day/night cycle, and an initial sound pass.

8. Summary
The Eternal Lobby is all about drawing players into an experience where they actively feel the lack of traditional gameplay progress. By using minimal yet immersive design, intermittent prompts that spark curiosity, and a communal chat setting, you can achieve a modern twist on Waiting for Godot’s existential atmosphere. Remember to focus on the tension between the players’ hope (that something might happen) and the near-certain knowledge that nothing will. The result should be a poetic, haunting space that keeps players lingering—longing for Godot, who, of course, never arrives.
